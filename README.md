# first-node-mini-project

<li> This is my very first project with node. What it does is that it creates a http server and when we open the server,we read index.html file which is our home page  and display it's content. </li>
<li>We can change the url of our page to /about and it will show the content of about file.</li>
<li> We can change the url of our page to /contact-me and it will read that file and display it's content. </li>
<li>Finally when we type something in our url which we don't have,it will read 404 page and display error message.</li>
